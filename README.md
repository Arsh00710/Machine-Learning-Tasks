Outlier detection is a crucial component of data analysis, aimed at identifying and addressing data points that significantly deviate from the majority of the dataset. These outliers, lying far from the bulk of the data, have the potential to skew statistical analyses, leading to biased findings and inaccurate interpretations. Detecting and appropriately handling outliers is vital for maintaining the integrity and reliability of data analysis.

There exist various methods for outlier detection, ranging from statistical techniques to visualization approaches. Statistical methods typically leverage measures of central tendency and dispersion, such as the mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range (IQR). These methods establish thresholds or ranges beyond which data points are flagged as outliers and either removed or treated accordingly.

Visualization techniques, including box plots, scatter plots, and histograms, offer graphical representations of the data that aid in outlier identification. For instance, box plots illustrate data distribution and highlight potential outliers as points outside the plot's whiskers. Scatter plots enable the visual examination of variable relationships, facilitating the identification of data points deviating from expected patterns.

The choice of outlier detection method should consider the data context and analysis objectives. While some methods suit normally distributed data, others prove robust against skewed distributions or outliers of varying magnitudes. Moreover, outlier detection is an iterative process, as removing outliers can influence subsequent analyses and may necessitate data reassessment.

Outlined below are common methods for outlier detection:

1. **Mean Function**: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the 'price_per_sqft' column. Define a range around the mean (commonly ±3 standard deviations). Keep only the data points within this range.

2. **Percentile Method (IQR)**: Calculate the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3). Compute the interquartile range (IQR) as Q3 - Q1. Define lower bound as Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and upper bound as Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. Keep only the data points within this range.

3. **IQR (Interquartile Range) Method**: Similar to the percentile method but without recalculating quartiles, directly utilizing Q1 and Q3 to define outlier boundaries.

4. **Normal Distribution (Z-score)**:Calculate the z-score for each data point using the formula: Z-score =(X−mean)/standard deviation

Define a threshold (commonly 3). Keep only the data points with absolute z-scores less than the threshold.

5. **Z-score Method**: Same steps as Normal Distribution but without the absolute value.

Each method carries its strengths and limitations, necessitating careful consideration of the data characteristics and analytical requirements. By employing appropriate outlier detection techniques, analysts can enhance the accuracy and validity of their analyses, facilitating informed decision-making based on dependable data.
